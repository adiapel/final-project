run instructions:
you need python 3.9 to run the program and to install the following packages:
- torch
- torchvision

and place it in data folder in the main project

in order to use pretrained model for CIFAR-10 dataset:
1. use this code:
    url = "https://huggingface.co/bhumong/resnet18_cifar10/resolve/main/resnet18_cifar10.pth"
    r = requests.get(url)
    open("data/resnet18_cifar10.pth", "wb").write(r.content)
2. uncomment the relevant line in create_CIFAR_10_model method
